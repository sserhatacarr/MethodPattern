# Recursive Number Operation

This Java program takes a number as input from the user and applies a recursive rule to it. The rule involves printing the number, subtracting 5, and then printing the number again. This process continues recursively until the number reaches 0 or becomes negative.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a number when prompted.
3. The program will apply the recursive rule and display the output.

## How It Works

The program defines a recursive method called `applyRule` that follows the specified rule until the number is 0 or negative. It prints the current number, subtracts 5, and then prints the number again.

## Example

Suppose the user enters `15`. The program will output: `15 10 5 0 5 10 15`.
